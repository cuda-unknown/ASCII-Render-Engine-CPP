# ASCII Shape Rendering Engine

A high-performance C++ engine developed to render geometric shapes within a terminal environment using dynamic memory management and optimized algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Resolution:** Utilizes double pointers for runtime screen scaling on high-end hardware.
- **Geometric Primitives:** Support for both Solid and Hollow Squares and Circles.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Implementation of `inline` functions and `macros` to reduce overhead.
- **Frame Manipulation:** Includes matrix transposition and mirroring for frame rotation.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Dynamic Memory Allocation (2D Arrays), Macros, Inline Functions, Matrix Manipulation.
- **Hardware Optimization:** Integrated `FastIO` hooks for high-speed terminal output.

## 📖 Learning Journey
This project is part of a Semester 4 B.Tech CSE track focusing on **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** and **Computer Networks (CN)**.
